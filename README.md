[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d077c787-d5c7-4091-b960-894a2c093181/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elvenbrill/deploys)

My personal [website](https://elvenbrill.xyz). There are many like it, but this is mine.

## Motivation

This is a much-needed update for my personal website. It's less a portfolio and more a centralized reference for all my various internet-related activities.

## Installation

This website is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). To install this project, run these commands in your terminal:

1. `npm install`
1. `npx eleventy --serve`

## Contributing

As it is my personal website, I'm not really looking for feature requests for this project. I would, however, love to get bug reports, especially about accessibility issues, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability criticism.

The best way to submit these issues is using this repo's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/elvenbrill/elvenbrill.xyz/issues).

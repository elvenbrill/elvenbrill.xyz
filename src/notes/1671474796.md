In the decentralised world, the power should be concentrated at the user — not the instance admin. Federation is a first step towards empowering users, when migration between instances becomes as cheap as possible — ideally at zero cost for the user. You vote for an instance with your membership and the admin should know that "their" citizens can exercise their right to leave at any time, for any reason.
